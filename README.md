Designed an app and backend code for an online tool store using Java. 
 Defined classes for adding, editing, deleting, inserting, reading and writing in the master file.
 Advanced the code to not use linked lists and yet maintain speed and memory consumption, upon the request from our advisor (aka client).
 Received recognition as the top 3 projects in the class based on the speed and graphical design.
